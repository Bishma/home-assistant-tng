# 3.1 Weather Alerts sent to Telegram

User _finity_ on the Home Assistant Forums [posted a some REST sensors](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/severe-weather-alerts-from-the-us-national-weather-service/71853/11) for getting National Weather Service alerts from home assistant. I took this idea (and copy and pasted their REST sensor) to use as an automation that will send me alerts via Telegram. As _finity_ points out, this is a nice way to insulate you from the possible shutdown the of the Weather Underground API. It's also a fun use of a valuable pulic API. **Note:** The National Weather Service API's are for the US only.

Their implimentation is must more involved than mine and includes their Echo's alerting them the the weather alert. You should [check it out](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/severe-weather-alerts-from-the-us-national-weather-service/71853/11).

## Prerequisites

At this point I have already set up a Telegram bot named Janet (same as the invocation for my alexa skill)  as `notification.general`. That was set up using the [notification component's docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.telegram/).

## Sensors

Two REST sensors are used to pull from Nation Weather Service APIs.

The first looks for the total number of alerts in my area.

```YAML
- platform: rest
    resource: https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active/count
    name: NWS Alert Count
    value_template: >
      {% if value_json.zones.ORZ604 is defined %}
        {{ value_json.zones.ORZ604 | int }}
      {% elif value_json.zones.ORC039 is defined %}
        {{ value_json.zones.ORC039 | int }}
      {% else %}
        0
      {% endif %}
    headers:
      User-Agent: Homeassistant
      Accept: application/ld+json
    scan_interval: 300
```

This looks for alerts in my zone `ORZ604`, failing that it looks for alerts in my county `ORC039`, failing that it sets a value of 0 (zero). I have this set to update uvery 300 seconds (5 minutes).

The second sensor requests the actual alert data from my zone and county and feeds any existing value into it's sensor's Attributes under `features`. If there is none, then the state is set to None.

```YAML
- platform: rest
    resource: https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone=ORZ604,ORC039
    name: NWS Alert Event
    value_template: >
      {% if value_json.features[0] is defined %}
        {{ value_json['features'][0]['properties'].event }}
      {% else %}
        None
      {% endif %}
    json_attributes:
      - features
    headers:
      User-Agent: Homeassistant
      Accept: application/geo+json
    scan_interval: 300
```

## Automation

The automation is also largly taken from _finity's_ forum post. It uses a template condition to handle any change that results in a count from the first sensor that is greater than 0 (zero). If true the headline and description are passed via the second sensor's attributes to a data template. The message in that template is passed to Telegram via the `notify.general` service.

```YAML
- id: 'weather_alert_doooooom'
  alias: NWS Notification Weather Alert
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.nws_alert_count
  condition:
    condition: template
    value_template: '{{states.sensor.nws_alert_count.state | int > 0}}'
  action:
  - data_template:
      message: There has been a change in the weather alert status for our area.
      
        {{ state_attr('sensor.nws_alert_event', 'features')[0].properties.headline }}
        {{ state_attr('sensor.nws_alert_event', 'features')[0].properties.description }}
    service: notify.general
```

## Still to come

I want to add a Lovelace condition card to my outdoor climate tab that will pop up, hightlighted, showing that there's an alert. When I set up HTML notifications I may also want to push to that. I'm also considering changing the detailed sensor. Right now I like the flexibility of the full data from the API, but I don't think I'll want more than the headline and description.
